# datasets

See `notebooks/dataset-prep` for data sources and processings.

Note: The branch lengths in the main datasets (`02-bacteria/bacteria-main-v0.json.gz` and `03-fish/fish-main-v0.json.gz`) are not pre-processed (i.e., they remain as they are in the source data). Please keep this in mind when using these files.
